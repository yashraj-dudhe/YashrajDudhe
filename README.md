# 👋 Hello developer!
**This project contains a basic HTML structure to create your portfolio** 🦄
- by **Yashraj Dudhe**


## 🏗 What's next? 

Use these files as your starting point:

- **index.html:** This is the only important file for my portfolio. There is no .css, .js , I have included all my code here
so it becomes easier for you to copy paste
. 



## 🎨 Lets Begin
#1ST METHOD:

first copy all code from index.html from [Click Here to copy code](https://spaceb.in/GTdXsNXx)
Than paste it in whichever iDE you are using and save it as index.html 
Once done that upload it to whichever hosting service you are using or your github

- For next procedure read the end part of 2nd Method

#2ND METHOD: 
[**EASIER METHOD**]

first copy all code from index.html from [Click Here to copy code](https://spaceb.in/GTdXsNXx)
Than go to https://spaces.w3schools.com/ (This site is best for portfolio designing).
Create Account and get your domain for free with 100MB space which is more than eoungh for a portfolio.
Now start with blank document there you will see 4 sections:

	>style.css 

	>another with extension .js 

	>index.html (which is the only important file for us rest is not necessary)

	>And last READme.md 

Paste all the code u copied from [Click Here to copy code](https://spaceb.in/GTdXsNXx) to index.html and save and run program.

You will see basic structure with some text : like 
A student - Noob Programmer<br><i>Age:18</i></h5>
A noob programmer is a programmer who has basic knowledge of programming languages,copies/edits code which is already available! Makes changes according to his/her needs

You can edit this text as per your purposes.

Now you need Two pictures for your portfolio

>For background

>For your own profile picture

To upload That two pictures Create a sepreate folder named "images"
like this [click here](https://telegra.ph/file/3065bfe415adec5304b37.jpg)

- **Note** : make sure that the you chose a simple name for the two images

Now once you have uploaded that two images go to index.html file and check for this two lines 

	background-image: url("images/neonlights.jpg"); 

	<img src="images/corpse1.png" class="box-img">

edit the name of images as per your image name for example if your one picture name is lion.jpeg and other picture name is rose.png than the code should be like this
	
	background-image: url("images/lion.jpeg"); 


	<img src="images/rose.png" class="box-img">

Once you have done that save and run code you'll see your profile and background.

- **Background i used** [click here for my background](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.besthdwallpaper.com%2Fabstract%2Fneon-lights-radial-motion-dt_en-US-17207.html&psig=AOvVaw0SgRkBaDe5zyGZ38V4R2Ba&ust=1643384035969000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAsQjRxqFwoTCPD-v8mi0vUCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAN)
	
Now last step:

- **social media links** :
I have used my links 

	<li><a href="https://t.me/yashraj_dudhe"><i class="fa fa-telegram" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></li>
	<li><a href="https://twitter.com/yashrajdudhe"><i class="fa fa-twitter" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></li>
	<li><a href="https://instagram.com/yashraj_dudhe"><i class="fa fa-instagram" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></li>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/yashraj-dudhe"><i class="fa fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></i></a></li>

change the content inide of href = "your social media accounts links"

And save it and run, now once you click on social media icons it'll take you to your desired site
